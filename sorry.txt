I've had a rough week and haven't been able to work on my homework. I've attended all of the sessions, but haven't had an opportunity to focus on the homework.

I'm pleading with you to let me resubmit this and will work through it tomorrow. I understand if that isn't possible. 

Thanks,
Matt Chandler
